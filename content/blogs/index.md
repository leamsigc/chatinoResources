We are a perfect group to sponsor for any company or school that wishes
to attract more talent or candidates especially for classes, workshops,
trainings and job offers. Build your list and presence with this group
for way less than what it costs to advertise on popular Social Media
Platforms (e.g. Big Tech), and the great thing is youâ€™ll reach real
people <span>(not robots and fake profiles)!</span>

#subTitle
If you want to become a sponsor of our group, simply contact us via our
email <a href="mailto:info@wetzlar.dev">info@wetzlar.dev</a> .Please ask about 
Sponsorships in the subject line.
